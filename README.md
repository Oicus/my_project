# Keylogger Project

## Explanation of Improvements:
1. **Error Handling**: 
   - Added more detailed error messages to help diagnose issues.

2. **Configuration**: 
   - Used environment variables to configure the IP address, port number, and time interval. This makes the code more flexible and easier to configure without changing the source code.

3. **Logging**: 
   - Added logging to track the program's activity and errors. This is useful for debugging and monitoring the program's behavior.

4. **Documentation**: 
   - Added comments to explain the purpose of each part of the code.
